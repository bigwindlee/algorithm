  Backtracking | Set 1 (The Knight’s tour problem)

  If all squares are visited
    print the solution
  Else
    a) Add one of the next moves to solution vector and recursively
    check if this move leads to a solution. (A Knight can make maximum
    eight moves. We choose one of the 8 moves in this step).
    b) If the move chosen in the above step doesn't lead to a solution
    then remove this move from the solution vector and try other
    alternative moves.
    c) If none of the alternatives work then return false (Returning false
    will remove the previously added item in recursion and if false is
    returned by the initial call of recursion then "no solution exists" )
